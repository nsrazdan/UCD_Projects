# Overview
Each of the sub-repositories are individual, standalone projects created during my education at UC Davis. For a description of the project, see the README.md in each respective repository. Additionally, there will be a small description for each project in this document.

## Project Highlights
Machine Learning:
- If you are interested in my skills in Machine Learning, in effective communication, and in software engineering, I would recommend viewing the Machine Learning Weather Prediction repository.
- This project features a 50+ page report on the development, evaluation, and analysis of different ML models for predicting the weather.
Computer Vision:
- If you are interested in my skills with computer vision and working with big data, I would recommend viewing SIFT Image Classification and Context-Sensitive Image Resizing projects.
- These projects work with images to either create a visual vocabulary and classify objects, or to dynamically resize them, respectively.
Web Programming:
- If you are interested in my skills with web programming and software engineering, I would recommend viewing Restaurant Tinder.
- In this project, myself and my classmates created a website to aid a group of people to decide on a restaurant to eat at.
